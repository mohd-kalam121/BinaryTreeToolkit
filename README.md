# BinaryTreeToolkit

An interactive Java toolkit for learning and testing Binary Tree and BST operations from scratch.  
This project features **20+ functions** such as traversals, LCA, height, mirror, BST insert/search/delete, balancing, top view, sum tree conversion, and more.

## üìÇ Features
- Build tree from level order input
- Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
- Count nodes and compute sum
- Check height and if it's a valid BST
- Create mirror image of the tree
- Top View and Diameter calculation
- LCA, Kth Ancestor, and Min Distance between nodes
- Convert to Sum Tree
- Root to Leaf Path printing
- Insert, Delete, Search in BST
- Print values in range [K1, K2]
- Balance an unbalanced BST
- Find size of Largest BST in a Binary Tree

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
